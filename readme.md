# tSNESearch

An simple example of loading t-SNE data generated by [AudioNotebooks](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/AudioNotebooks).

In the folder specified in `settings.yml` there should be:

- `filenames.txt`: newline-separate absolute paths of sounds.
- `tsne/X.2d.tsv`: 0-1 normalized tab separated 2d positions for each sound.
- `tsne/X.3d.tsv`: 0-1 normalized tab separated 3d colors for each sound.

X is usually an integer corresponding to the perplexity of the t-SNE run.
